year, you definitely had the look of a throwback player and you even play the
game that way. Would you agree?A: I like playing the game hard. I like how old school (players)
used to play, so I try to bring that back by playing hard-nosed and just
playing the game how I know how to.[[MORE]]Q: When you took the team headshots this year you have short
hair. Is the long hair something new?A: Throughout high school, I had a mullet. Before I came
here I decided that I should to shave it off to give a good impression, but I
have decided to grow it back to go back to my old self. I like being different
from everyone else, so that is kind of my key to it.Q: How about the mustache? 
Will that return?A: Absolutely, the mustache will return.Q: Is there a reason you got rid of it? Are you
superstitious at all?A: I&rsquo;m very superstitious and that is why I had a normal
mustache and then I decided to dye it black &ndash; just to mix up the mojo a bit. It
worked for quite a while, but then it wore off &ndash; so it had to come off.Q: You bring a lot of versatility to the game by being able
to play infield and outfield. Is that something you have always done?A: I have played infield my whole life and when I did play
outfield it was usually centerfield. It&rsquo;s been quite a difference playing right
because you have to make adjustments. Then you throw in the adjustments moving
from right to third base and then the difference between high school and college
&ndash; it is a totally different game.Q: You seem really comfortable in the leadoff role. Is that
something you have experience at?A: I have led off my whole life and when I saw that I was
leading off in (my first college game) I was nervous and shocked. But after
that first game I kind of fell into place and started getting the hang of it.Q: Freshman Devin Foyle is also from Arizona. Did you two
know of each other prior to KU?A: Devin and I actually grew up together. I didn&rsquo;t know he
was coming to Kansas until close to summer. But when I found out he was coming,
I was pretty happy. We have been playing (baseball) together since we were 12
and now that we are 19 playing in college together is something we never would
have expected. &nbsp;Q: What has been your early impression of Big 12 baseball?A: The competition in the Big 12 is a lot different than
high school baseball, that&rsquo;s for sure. Skip (head coach Ritch Price) prepared
us well and I believe as time goes on we are going to get on a streak and we are
going to compete against the top teams.Q: Talk a little bit about your family.A: My family means the world to me, especially my
grandparents. They are the ones who were around my whole life teaching me the
game of baseball. My grandmother just recently passed away but my grandpa, he&rsquo;s
my mom&rsquo;s dad, lives in Minnesota. That guy means the world to me. He watches
every game from home but when we play at Minnesota (later in the season) he is
definitely going to be there.Q: One thing people might not know about you is that you
have epilepsy. When did you find that out?A: I believe it was seventh grade. I was asleep one night
and my sister heard something going on in my room. She came in and checked in
on me and realized I was unconscious. There was blood all over my face and my
parents called 911. I was in the hospital for a week and I don&rsquo;t remember that
whole week. The last thing I remember about it was I saw my whole family and my
buddy in the hospital. I remember my mom telling me that &ldquo;they are not helping
you right now, because they are busy.&rdquo; The funny part is that my buddy&rsquo;s dad
owns a bunch of Olive Gardens and (his family) brought (the staff) dinner and
immediately they started getting tests done on me and that is when they found
out I had epilepsy.Q: To what extent are your seizures?A: Once in a while I get grand mal seizures, which are the
worst seizures. But mine are typically just where my upper body and head clinch
tight and my head twitches really bad. I don&rsquo;t why, but lately I seem to not be
remembering them. Usually I am aware of what is going on and I remember them.Q: Are you able to get some relief via medication?A: Yes, every morning I take two types of medicine to help
me, but there are just days where it isn&rsquo;t going to work. Usually when there is
one seizure there is a lot after it. That is just something I have learned to
take care of. When I have one, I have to take care of the ones coming after
that.Q: Have you noticed any triggers?A: It is usually when I get a lack of sleep or I am
dehydrated. &nbsp;The key factor is when I am
really stressed. That is one thing that really gets my mind going. I have grown
to take care of that by not stressing as much, living life and having fun.Q: That is a great way to live, but as a freshman adjusting
to college, moving from Arizona to Kansas, playing every day Big 12 baseball
and leading off, how have you avoided stress?A: When I first came to Kansas it was a big change. Once we
started school, I was having a lot of seizures. We couldn&rsquo;t understand what was
going on and I started seeing a new doctor here. We switched up medications and
it seems to be going well. Now that I have come along with the team and we have
all bonded and become close brothers that definitely has helped me settle in
and not be so stressed about everything. I love it here and it doesn&rsquo;t make me
nervous.Q: How many seizures would you say you average a month?A: A month? It&rsquo;s usually every two months. But, once I have
one, I usually get around seven. After there is one, there is a lot more after
it.Q: Have you ever experienced one on the field while playing
baseball?A: So far at Kansas I have not, but in high school I would a
lot. I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody, because that&rsquo;s how I am &ndash; I play the game and I
don&rsquo;t want to be taken out. Whenever it would happen, I would try to keep it (on
the) low. My dad knows when something is wrong so he would always come up to me
and say &ldquo;hey, I know something is wrong with you.&rdquo; I would just kind of deny
it, but now that I am in college it is kind of a big deal now. So far we
haven&rsquo;t had to go through that, so that&rsquo;s good.Q: Having a friend in Devin also at Kansas and someone aware
of your epilepsy, is that nice having him here to kind of keep an eye out on you?A: He&rsquo;s definitely my brother. He actually didn&rsquo;t know I had
epilepsy until we were juniors in high school. He found out I had it and didn&rsquo;t
know what to expect when I had a (seizure). In the beginning of our first
semester (at KU) he finally saw what happened. I felt bad, because I didn&rsquo;t
really give him a heads up of what happens (when I am having a seizure). I gave
him an idea, but when it happens it is way different than what you tell people.
When you actually see it happen it is a lot bigger deal than when someone tells
you. But he was definitely aware and knew what to do and I couldn&rsquo;t ask for
anyone better to be there for me.Q: Do you sense people treating you differently once they
become aware of your condition?A: When people hear I have epilepsy they try being nice and
they try being soft. I don&rsquo;t like that. I don&rsquo;t care that I have it and I just
want to go out and do my business. I go along with life and have fun. When
people try feeling bad, I just don&rsquo;t. I have it, so what? Let&rsquo;s do it. Let&rsquo;s
live life. It is not a big deal to me." />

I used
to take my pencils and pens and draw simple doodles and letters with
decorations. I didn&rsquo;t really (formally) get into it until I came (to Kansas). I
didn&rsquo;t take any art classes in high school, so I had never really drawn a
person or landscape back then.[[MORE]]Q: What was the reaction to some of your early doodles?A: I met with someone this past summer and she was a referee
at one of my tournaments and she said that they had a picture of me drawing in
the newspaper. I didn&rsquo;t know about it until she mentioned it, but I guess it
had a little (article) with it too. People also used ask me to draw their names
during the tournaments.Q: Do you have a favorite medium?A: Pastels are my favorite. I can blend and do more stuff
with them. It is really messy, but I don&rsquo;t care.Q: A lot of the samples you have brought with you are of
landscapes. Is that what you enjoy the most?A: I do like landscapes, but I think I prefer doing
portraits. There was one with three faces that I drew &ndash; one in charcoal, one in
pastels and one in color pencil. I just love doing those big portraits of
people.Q: I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that you bring the sport of
tennis into some of your pieces.A: Yes. Actually, in a lot of my projects that I have had
this past year I have incorporated a lot of tennis. I like to bring that in.Q: So would you consider art a creative outlet for you?A: Every time I draw I get into that dimension and I forget
about everything else. I could probably spend five hours straight just drawing
and I forget about everything. So, I like that &ndash; not worrying about anything
else.Q: Is your time contributed to your art around your classes
right now, or are you able to put additional time toward it?A: With my classes, I am so busy with the projects I already
have I don&rsquo;t have time to do extra or side projects. So, yes, it is just class
projects now, but I love spending time doing those.Q: What officially is your major and what are you hoping to
do for a career?A: Illustration Animation. Hopefully more illustration. I
like animation, but I don&rsquo;t think I want to go down that path. I hope I can
work with a journal or doing editorial work with portraits or illustrations for
a magazine, newspaper or freelance.Q: You&rsquo;re listed on the roster as being from Chile, but in
your bio it mentions you were born in Colombia. When did you make that move? A: I was 13 when I had decided to move to Chile. I had gone
to Chile two months before moving, because of tennis, and I really liked the
academy that I went to practice and train. I told my mom that I wanted to move
and surprisingly my parents said yes.Q: So, you moved to Chile by yourself at age 13?A: Yes. I lived in Chile for a year with one of my friend&rsquo;s
family. They pretty much adopted me and it was really good living with them for
a year, but it isn&rsquo;t the same as living with your parents. A year later, my mom
moved with me.Q: Did you experience a culture transition moving to Chile
from Colombia?A: The cultures are really different. I like Chile where I
live now, but Colombian people are happier and more positive. They are warmer I
guess. If you were to go to Colombia, they would receive you with a big smile
and they will make you feel like you are at home. You don&rsquo;t get that as much in
Chile.Q: When you look back at that first year in Chile without
your mom, what do you remember?A: It was really difficult because my mom is pretty much
like my best friend. Not having her around when I had problems or when I just
needed a hug was hard. It taught me a lot about being independent and taught me
solutions to solve the problems I had. I think that helped me when I moved to
(Lawrence, Kansas) and being by myself.Q: Did your mom stay with you then until you came to the
United States and then move back to Columbia?A: No, she is still in Chile. I left her again (laughing).Q: Essentially, you have been on your own since the age of
13. Are you pretty independent?A: With tournaments, I have been to pretty much every
country in South America and I got to go to Mexico, Costa Rica and Europe. &nbsp;(I went to) like five countries in Europe, so
I was traveling a lot in Juniors. We used to go on tours for five to six weeks,
so I was spending all that time without my parents. I have been on my own for a
while.Q: Growing up as an only child and being on your own at a
young age, do you feel like your upbringing is catered toward the individualism
of the sport of tennis?A: Maybe. Tennis is really lonely, I guess. You are by
yourself and I never really played as a team back home. That has been a
transition too because I was used to training for myself and playing for
myself. When I came here my coaches were telling me this is a team. There is no
I in team and that you play for the team first and for yourself second. Even
though we are playing our matches individually, we are still playing for the
team. That&rsquo;s a nice feeling actually, having your teammates behind you.Q: During your Juniors tours and all the travels you made,
had you been to the United States?A: No, I was never in the States until I came to KU. I
didn&rsquo;t know anything about the States and, to be honest, I was never interested
in coming here. There was a perception among tennis players that coming to play
in the U.S., was your last option, because we were ignorant in the fact that it
wasn&rsquo;t competitive and that the level of play wasn&rsquo;t any good. When I came here
I realized that it is not true and (tennis players) are given everything we
need to be the best athletes. The level here is just impressive. There are
girls who I think for sure can become professionals.Q: We talked about the transition from Colombia to Chile,
how about the one from Chile to the U.S.?A: It was really hard. I was on my own again and I didn&rsquo;t
know the language as well. I knew one of my teammates from back home, but I
didn&rsquo;t know anyone else. It was hard to adapt to that. (In Chile) I went to a
high school for athletes so we didn&rsquo;t study as much, so it was transition
balancing classes and tennis at the same time. It was hard.Q: How long did it take for you to feel comfortable in the
States?A: Probably until my second semester of my freshman year. I
was in level five of the English program and what I learned was mostly writing.
But just being here allowed me to practice on getting my words out faster and
not being afraid of making mistakes. I think during that spring semester I
started getting words out even more.Q: Has technology able to help you bridge that gap with your
mom?A: Pretty much. I call her every day and text her all the
time.Q: What is it that you enjoy the most about the U.S.,
especially Lawrence and KU?A: I am just really amazed by the culture of the University,
we don&rsquo;t have anything like that back home. 
People are just so proud about coming (to KU) and really happy about
being at the University of Kansas. Our team is also just like a family and that
has helped me to overcome obstacles. It is great having that family behind me.
I think that is what I enjoy the most.Q: Now, it is my understanding that Maria Jose has different
nicknames in both Colombia and Chile. Is that true?A: Yes, in Colombia Maria Jose is Majo. That is the
nickname. But, in Chile it is Cote. So when I went to Chili everyone started
calling me Cote and I didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about. Then I realized
there was just a different nickname. I like Cote more. I don&rsquo;t know why, so I
just stuck with that and it is what everyone calls me here too.Q: Maria Jose must be a pretty common name then?A: Yes, it is in South America.Q: In intercollegiate tennis and the team aspect there is a
lot of cheering and vocal support that goes on at a match amongst the team, I&rsquo;m
sure that was a transition as well.A: It is good to have that support. You feel like your
teammates have your back. When I go back home for the breaks and I practice in
my old academy and I just want to yell &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go Hawks!&rdquo; But, that would be
weird (laughing). You just don&rsquo;t get the same feeling because everyone is so
quiet and you just want to get pumped up." />

collegiate athlete, you win your event at you first-ever college meet. &nbsp;What was that experience like?A: I was just anxious. I was so excited to be here and I just kind of
went out there and did it. [[MORE]]Q: After you won the event did you think about it at all, like &ldquo;Wow, I
haven&rsquo;t even been on campus a week and already I have finished first in a
meet?&rdquo;A: I didn&rsquo;t really think about it until the next Monday when I had my first
meeting with the team and (Coach Redwine) pointed it out and I started to think
I must have done a good job.Q: Six days prior to that meet, you moved to Lawrence and into Jayhawk
Towers. &nbsp;What was that first week like
leading up to your first collegiate meet?A: The first day I had to get a physical and then on the second day I
was in practice. &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t waste any
time.Q: As you got ready for your first approach on your first college high jump,
what was going through your mind?A: I was really nervous. I was praying that I didn&rsquo;t miss it. I knew I
was rusty and had not jumped in a while. I really just wanted to impress my
team to show everyone that I was here for a reason. I had a lot going on, but
when I took that first step it just all flew out of my head. Q: Getting that first jump out of the way, is that you needed?A: Yes, sir.Q: You mentioned you were rusty and hadn&rsquo;t jumped in a while, but you
were still training in Texas during the fall, correct?A: &nbsp;Ummm &hellip; well, I attempted to
train. It is just hard to train on your own. I was good for a little while, but
then I kind of fell off. I got back into the groove here really quick with our
workouts. It&rsquo;s been different here, because I never really lifted weights in
high school or any of the really hard core stuff. &nbsp;But I am used to it now in the month that I
have been here.Q: Are you starting to see the physical improvements in yourself from
the difference in workouts at the college level?A: Yes. &nbsp;I am way stronger right
now. I feel like the power is going to allow me to jump higher and take me to
new heights.Q: Speaking of new heights. Your career best high jump is 5-foot-10 and
you stand 6-feet tall. You are just two inches away from being able to jump
over yourself, if that makes sense. 
Doesn&rsquo;t that just blow your mind?A: Not really, because I think if I thought about it like that I would
get a little bit scared. Track, in general, is more mental than physical and if
you think about the bar being too high you are going to mess yourself up and
not clear. I try not to think about it like, &ldquo;Dang. I am about to jump over my
head!&rdquo;Q: With the training and coaching that you are getting at Kansas, you
will be jumping over that 6-foot mark.A: I plan on being able to do that by the end of this year, as a
freshman.Q: When did your passion and involvement in track and field begin?A: I competed in track in eighth grade, but I was also playing
basketball so I wasn&rsquo;t really thinking about track. I didn&rsquo;t compete as a
freshman, but when I was a sophomore my dad said &ldquo;You should try it again. I
know it is a lot of running and all, but you should do it.&rdquo; So I went back and
did it my sophomore year and I made it to state, so then I started to think
maybe this was for me. &nbsp;I just kept with
it and fell in love with it.Q: So did your basketball career come to an end?A: Yeah, that sophomore year I stopped and focused on track.Q: Were you just a jumper in high school as well?A: No, I ran. I had to do the 400 and the 200 on the relays.Q: Do you miss the running part of the sport?A: I do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s hard,
but it&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s worth it.Q: Is there a jumper you have looked up to?A: Not really any particular high jumper, but Jenna Prandini was a long
jumper at Oregon. I look up to her because she does it all. She runs and
jumps. &nbsp;She does the 100 and 200 and long
jumps. So, I would like to kind of be like her and do the high jump, long jump
and maybe the 400. I don&rsquo;t know.Q: Do you see running in your future here at KU?A: I think it might. I&rsquo;m kind of nervous because I see them running in
practice and they really run hard. We ran hard in high school, but college is
whole new level.Q: It didn&rsquo;t take you long to notice the difference then between level
of athlete in high school and college then?A: No, sir. &nbsp;It did not. Not at
all.Q: You are from DeSoto, Texas. 
What was it like living and growing up there?A: It&rsquo;s the suburbs, so you didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about much. The
school is a pretty big school with a lot of kids. It was a football/track
school, so all the football games and track meets were crazy entertaining. It
was a lot of fun and never really a dull moment.Q: Since moving to Lawrence, what is the thing you have missed most
about Texas?A: Whataburger.Q: Who do you think has had the most influence on you in your life?A: I would say my mom and my brothers, who both run track (Tyris and
Andre).Q: You come from a large family with five siblings. Were they all
active in track and field and what was it like growing up?A: Tyris runs for Kansas State and Andre is getting ready to go pro and
get ready for the Olympics. He jumped 26 feet last year, so he is getting
pretty close. &nbsp;We would all come together
over the summers. &nbsp;The summers were crazy
fun. We always went swimming and played beach volleyball &ndash; it was just fun.
Summers were just awesome. My dad has this little house in the country and when
we started going there my older brother was 16 so he had a license. He would
take us to go eat, train for track and we just had fun. Q: It sounds like those summers together were big for your family. Were
there any other family traditions growing up?A: We have some pretty intense bowling competitions on the Wii. That&rsquo;s
a good tradition right there. We would probably all get together every other
weekend.Q: What have been some of the benchmarks for you in your athletic
career?A: Even though I didn&rsquo;t do great at the meet, I would say New Balance
indoor. I got to go to New York and I got to experience top-notch
competition. &nbsp;Everybody there was the
best of the best. It was a pretty good meet. State was a pretty good meet too. I
feel like those two meets, experience wise, showed me where I need to be, how
hard I have to work and to never get too big-headed and to stay humble.Q: I know you are relatively new to the long jump, what are the differences
for you between it and the high jump?A: I don&rsquo;t want to say that the long jump is more intense, but it is
more technical. You have to drive the knee, you have to use your arms, you have
to be fast &ndash; it is a little bit more technical than the high jump. You have to
make sure you have a good landing, you have to have a strong core and strong
hips. &nbsp;There is a lot that goes into the
long jump. It is so fun for those few seconds you get to fly in the air. You
get to fly too in the high jump, but there&rsquo;s a different vibe to it with the
long jump.Q: To the novice, how key is the approach in both the long jump and the
high jump?A: They have to be precise and you have to make sure you run the same
way in both events every time. If you don&rsquo;t, your steps will be off and you
won&rsquo;t jump far and you won&rsquo;t jump high. Even if you go in just a little bit
faster, it might mess up your whole approach. If you are going to speed up your
approach you might have to go back a foot or even just a toe, just so it feels
the same as before. You have to be precise. 
Once you take off it is either right or wrong &ndash; there is no in between.Q: A lot of jumpers like to work the crowd into their approach and get
a steady clap. Where do you fall?A: When I get to higher levels, I am going to want to entertain the
crowds. Five-foot-10 is a great jump don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but it is not going to
get me a win at the NCAAs in May. When I start jumping 6-foot-2 or 6-foot-4, oh
yeah definitely, I am going to want to get the crowd involved. But as for right
now, I am just working hard in silence.Q: Being a long jumper and a high jumper, which coach do you work with?A: I get to work with two coaches &ndash; both Coach (Tom) Hays and Coach
(Wayne) Pate. It&rsquo;s fun for me because I get to work out with two groups, where
most people are in the same group all the time. I get to talk to everybody so
it&rsquo;s fun. Coach Hays is more calm and collected, while Coach Pate is not in
your face at all, but he is not as settled I will say. (Coach Pate) is more
like &ldquo;drop your knee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;when you do it you need to make your last three
steps faster.&rdquo; Coach Hays is more of &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t get it this time, you will
definitely get it next time and we will definitely work out harder.&rdquo;" />

You spent your holiday break climbing Mount Kilimanjaro? How did that come
about?A: I&rsquo;m, a little bit impulsive. I grew up in Portland (Oregon) so my
mom is a big hiker and my dad is really outdoorsy too, so I kind of grew up
doing a lot of hiking. Then in August of 2015, I decided I wanted more of an
adventure and decided that Kilimanjaro was the best course of action. It is
kind of funny to think about, but I also have a good friend, who is from South
Africa, and Kilimanjaro has been on her bucket list for a long time. She&rsquo;s the
one that brought it up, but then she ended up being the one not going. It ended
up being me and another good friend of mine (Megan Falcon &ndash; assistant women&rsquo;s
tennis coach at Gonzaga).[[MORE]]Q: That&rsquo;s all it took to plan a hike 19,341 feet up a mountain, was a
few conversations?A: We started talking about it in August and then three weeks after
that we were all in.Q: &nbsp;You just bought a plane
ticket to Tanzania and flew down there?A: We went with a guide service, KE Adventures is the one who set it
up. &nbsp;Obviously, we talked to them and set
it up so we knew a little bit about what we were getting into, but I&rsquo;m not sure
we knew what exactly was going to happen on this trip.Q: It was just you and Megan, or was there anyone
else in your group? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: Yes, it was just us two and then there was a British guy (David) that
came who we didn&rsquo;t know until that day.Q: Aren&rsquo;t the groups normally bigger for a trek up a mountain like
this?A: It just depends. &nbsp;We were
going on a more obscure route, because we came up the north side of
Kilimanjaro. There are eight or nine treks up to the top of Kilimanjaro and we
did the Rongai route and that comes up the north side, which is the Kenya side,
and it isn&rsquo;t as popular. We did that on purpose because we didn&rsquo;t want to be
around so many people. &nbsp;This route also
allows you to see both sides because you come up the north side and then go
down the south. So we got to see both sides. There are distinguished camp sites
that you have to stay at, so at those campsites there are other companies with
other people. &nbsp;At any time, there are 10
to 30 trekkers depending on the day. Q: Is Kilimanjaro the first mountain you have climbed?A: Yes, the first true mountain at almost 20,000 feet. The first
mountain like that for sure. Before this, 14,000 feet was the highest I had
ever been. Q: How long did it take you to reach the summit?A: Seven days, six nights. &nbsp;Yeah,
six nights in a tent. Not washing my hair for six nights was horrible. I never
want to do that again.Q: What do you feel was your biggest challenge?A: The summit day is obviously the most challenging. &nbsp;They wake you up at 11:30 at night, so it is
the day before technically. So we were supposed to summit on Christmas Day and
they woke us up at 11:30 p.m., on Christmas Eve. You basically trek all day, so
we started at midnight. &nbsp;It is supposed
to take around eight hours using the Rongai route to get from base camp up to
Uhuru Peak. &nbsp;Most people don&rsquo;t know this
&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t know it; &nbsp;Kilimanjaro has
three peaks. There is Mawenzi and there is Uhuru which is the highest one, it
is actually the one that everyone climbs and treks, and then there is
Shira. &nbsp;But Shira and Mawenzi you can&rsquo;t
get to the top of and they are quite a bit smaller than Uhuru.Q: You made it to the peak on Christmas Day?A: Yes, Christmas Day. It was supposed to take eight hours, but Megan
and I made it in four hours and 26 minutes, which was the fastest time of the
year. So it was pitch black (when we reached the summit) because the sun
doesn&rsquo;t rise until 6:30. Q: Did you and Megan just wait a couple of hours at the summit for the
sun to rise?A: No, because it was so cold. It had to have been negative 20 or 25
degrees Fahrenheit. We took some pictures and there is no light pollution. &nbsp;It was almost a full moon and the stars were
so bright that we could see everything. 
We couldn&rsquo;t get great pictures from the top, but we could see
everything. &nbsp;We were up there for about
five or six minutes and then we were like &ldquo;we are getting down.&rdquo; It was 50 mile
per hour winds and freezing cold. &nbsp;That
was a hard part too; the cold and trekking for that long. It&rsquo;s a hard day and
then by that point you are at quite a bit of altitude already. So that is where
a lot of people start getting high-altitude sickness and dealing with
that. We were both fine, which was nice.Q: Neither of you had issues with the altitude at all?A: No. &nbsp;We took medicine. I was
on Diamox, which is a high-altitude medicine. It doesn&rsquo;t, obviously, 100
percent help, but it helped me enough to where I wasn&rsquo;t sick. I didn&rsquo;t have
much of an appetite and didn&rsquo;t feel like eating much, which was probably the
only symptom that I had.Q: How does the decline compare to assent?A: That was the best part, because going to the top you do all these
switchbacks and it is steep, you are literally walking uphill until you get to
the top. On the way down, they call it Kilimanjaro skiing and you just go
straight down for the rest of it. Basically, there are these big ash fields
with small little pebbles. You just slide back and forth like skiing all the
way down the mountain.Q: It took you seven days to climb to the top. How long does it take on
the decline?A: It only takes two hours. I think it is supposed to take about four,
but it took us two. &nbsp;We were both ready
to be done. We had been on this mountain for six days already. Q: What do you think was the biggest thing you learned about yourself
on this trip?A: I think one thing I had to learn was patience, because I am used to
hiking for exercise so I want to push myself and go really hard and work up a
sweat in the first 15 or 20 minutes. Following a guide, and they say &ldquo;pole,
pole,&rdquo; which means slow down, slow down (in Swahili). (The guide&rsquo;s) whole goal
is to get you to base camp with as much energy as possible. So they go really
slow for the first five days. Really slow &ndash; and I was not accustomed to that
and I&rsquo;m a go-getter. &nbsp;I wanted to get to
our next camp. I wanted to take pictures on the way, but I didn&rsquo;t really want
stop and we had to do all these 10 minute breaks. That was really difficult for
me because I had to go at a pace that was really uncomfortable to me. I&rsquo;m
really glad I did, because there were other people in other groups who didn&rsquo;t
and they didn&rsquo;t make it to the top because that last day is incredibly
strenuous. But that patience and enjoying the journey &ndash; I&rsquo;m a destination
person &ndash; so enjoying the journey was a little more difficult, but I learned to
appreciate it a lot more. I saw a lot more because I was going at a pace to
enjoy the journey. Q: Accomplishing this challenge, has it opened the doors for more? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s next?A: I was laughing with my mom because I was saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never doing
this again!&rdquo; Since she hikes a lot, she is interested in doing Kilimanjaro, so
I told her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never doing it (again) so don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;In a
month Caroline, you are going to start planning another adventure.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t say
now what is going to happen next. It was a great experience and was one of, if
not thee, most challenging things I have ever done. From what I had read and
from what others had said, I knew it would be hard. I think it was more
difficult than I expected. I like that. I like challenging myself. Everest is
probably out. That is just way too long and way too cold and way too dangerous.
Who knows what&rsquo;s next?Q: Backtracking. Your friend, from South Africa, the one with
Kilimanjaro on her bucket list, did she ever end up making the trek?A: She tried, but didn&rsquo;t go with us. 
She actually went on the trip with another company a couple of days
before us. She didn&rsquo;t make it to the top. She suffered from pretty significant
high-altitude sickness. That is a little bit of the fear going in. I&rsquo;m flying
across the world. I don&rsquo;t know anything about the trip. I knew basics, but I
didn&rsquo;t know much. I don&rsquo;t know what I am going to be eating. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what it is going to look like. I
don&rsquo;t know what my tents look like. They tell you that you can only bring 20
kilos. So I am thinking in my head &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing and it&rsquo;s freezing cold up
there.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t know how you are going to react to the high altitude. Even on
the high-altitude medicine you can have incredibly bad symptoms and that is
something that is completely outside of your control. It is always in the back
of your mind, &ldquo;How high can I get before I become symptomatic?&rdquo; It is a little worrisome
as you continue to gain elevation.Q: How nervous were you on the flight over just thinking about all
these unknowns?A: We got there three days early and actually went on a day safari
before we went on our trek. We were like, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in Africa. When are we going
to be here again? We might as well make use of the time we have here.&rdquo; Every
day we were there it just kept mounting and mounting and I will never forget we
got in the truck and they are driving us to the beginning of the Rongai route.
From our hotel (the drive) was four to five hours and as we are driving I
hadn&rsquo;t seen Kilimanjaro yet. We flew into Arusha, Tanzania, at night, so I
couldn&rsquo;t see anything. Then, you can&rsquo;t see it from Arusha. You have to get
outside of Arusha because it is so hilly and there are mountains all around. We
are driving and all of sudden I look to my left and they were like &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
Kili.&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;That is a big mountain &ndash; Oh, my gosh!&rdquo; That was the
come to Jesus moment right there &ndash; it is huge! Mount Hood, for example, the one
I grew up looking at, is 11,000 feet and I was like, &ldquo;That is almost two Mount
Hoods.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s so big. That was probably the moment where I was the most
scared.Q: It is not just climbing mountains, you like to get yourself out of
your comfort zone. In your short time involved with college athletics you have
been a part of several campuses. A student-athlete at Kentucky and Georgia Tech
and a coach at Purdue, Gonzaga and now here at Kansas. How have you handled
that much transition?A: I think the more you expose yourself to the things that make you
uncomfortable. I moved to Lawrence, Kansas, and I kind of knew Todd (Chapman).
I had interviewed with him and we had discussions, but that was the one person
I knew in the state of Kansas. When you are constantly putting yourself in
uncomfortable positions, I think you are continuing to grow. It&rsquo;s not that I
want to continue moving around, don&rsquo;t get me wrong there, as you put yourself
in those uncomfortable situations you find out a lot about yourself. You find
out kind of what you are made of, you grow and you try to better yourself. Q: Since you have been a part of several campuses, what has really
jumped out to you about KU?A: I think a big part of what drew me to Kansas as a whole was the
people that I am surrounded by. Everyone is incredibly innovative and forward
thinking and they are constantly trying to better themselves. I think that is
rare to find in an athletic department. I haven&rsquo;t seen it a ton and I have been
at a lot of schools. I think it is easy sometimes for people to desire comfort
and complacency and to kind of get into their routine. That is one thing about
Kansas that I really appreciate &ndash; people want to be better. They want to be
better tomorrow than they are today. That is incredibly important to them and
they cherish that. Every single person is buying into that process and that is
what makes KU special. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are women&rsquo;s tennis or another
sport on campus, every single person is driving in that direction. The
financial support and the human support is just incredible. Then when you look
at the greater Lawrence area or Kansas as a whole, everyone loves the Jayhawks.
I went to Georgia Tech. Everyone loved Georgia. So, I&rsquo;m not used to be the one
that everyone loves. It&rsquo;s really awesome when you are in an airport, whether it
is New York or Phoenix, or all over the country &ndash; when I was in Spain and I had
someone say &ldquo;Rock Chalk&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;Wait. What? &nbsp;That is the first English I have heard in
five days.&rdquo; That is amazing to me. The brand of this school is all over the
country and it is a really special place to work. Q: You mentioned Coach Chapman and since his arrival in Lawrence he has
taken the KU women&rsquo;s tennis program to new heights. Talk a little about where
you see this program heading.A: That was a huge piece of why I chose to come here, because Todd is
such a hard worker. I believe in his mission and his vision for the program and
the direction in which he is taking it. I bought in. I really, truly believe
that he is an unbelievable leader, not just because of his knowledge of the
game or because he is willing to work hard, but because he leads with
character. He is an unbelievable role model for the girls. And he is an
unbelievable father to his five daughters and unbelievable husband to his wife.
To be working for someone like that, who truly leads with character, and he
cares about the girls &ndash; that allows us to move in a positive direction. I think
this fall we made huge strides. Anastasiya (Rychagova) is top-50 in the nation
as a freshman. We have four girls who are regionally ranked, which has never
happened in Kansas history. At regionals, we had four in the quarterfinals. We
really made huge strides, but more than anything we have a group that buys in
to being the best they can be every single day. It is a pleasure to work with
them because every single day they are working to get better and they are
looking to control their controllables and they are looking to push themselves
and each other and hold themselves accountable. I think for the first time in
my coaching career, I think we can do unbelievable things because of the
character of our team, because of the character of the leadership and because
of the talent. We have unbelievable girls. They want to work. It is one thing
to be talented and it is one thing to be a hard worker, but when you have both
of those things and you have that mix of the grittiness it takes to be
successful when things aren&rsquo;t going well and also that competitive fire. &ldquo;Hey,
I don&rsquo;t care what is written across someone else&rsquo;s chest, I&rsquo;m more proud that
Kansas is written across mine.&rdquo; That &ldquo;it&rdquo; factor is something that we have this
year that is going to continue to propel us forward. Q: The question that has to be asked &ndash; you spent two years at Kentucky
and have now been at Kansas. Who has the better men&rsquo;s basketball game day
experience?A: I can&rsquo;t stand the Wildcats. It is all about Allen Fieldhouse. It&rsquo;s
all about the Jayhawks. I&rsquo;m missing the game this year which is a little
disappointing, but I know we are going to beat them. &nbsp;Definitely the Jayhawks!" />

football team.Q: Nolan Cromwell, Steve Tasker, Mark Simoneau and even the voice of
the Chiefs Mitch Holthus all call Smith Center home. With only a population of
1,600, how has Smith Center produced so many individuals?A: It is super small. The closest Walmart is probably an hour away,
which I tell the girls that and they are amazed and are like, &ldquo;How do you do
that?&rdquo; Smith Center is really about athletics, so just growing up there was
kind of cool to be a part of that. I wasn&rsquo;t in high school when the huge
football thing was going on, I was in junior high still, but it was pretty
cool.[[MORE]]Q: Is Smith Center one of those communities where it is empty on a road
football game night?A: Yes! &nbsp;The road games were
packed. It&rsquo;s crazy. It&rsquo;s fun and it is a big tradition there.Q: What was it like for you growing up in Smith Center?A: I actually live on a farm. I don&rsquo;t even live in Smith Center. I live
in Esbon, Kansas, which is even smaller. I had to drive 20 minutes to school. I
think it is lot different than some of these other kids that go to huge schools.
I graduated with 40 people; I know everyone and everyone knows everything about
me. It was fun. I liked it.Q: What have you found to be the advantages for you growing up on a
farm?A: I think my dad definitely taught me how to work hard on a farm.
Every summer, me, my sister and my brothers have thistle spray duty. That&rsquo;s
great, but I do think that the farm really has shaped me into who I am &ndash; to
work hard and everything pays off.Q: Coming from the farm life, is it safe to assume that you don&rsquo;t mind
early-morning workouts?A: I&rsquo;m not the biggest morning person, which is sad. I think everyone
is a little afraid of early-morning workouts. They are pretty tough, but
everyone gets through it. Q: What were your duties on the farm?A: Mostly my duties were in the summer and I sprayed thistles. They
honestly gave us the jobs they didn&rsquo;t want to do, like cleaning the sheds and
the barn and all of that stuff. Those were most of &nbsp;my duties on the farm. The biggest thing on
our farm is the third weekend of March we have a huge bull sale, so we prep for
that all week. I haven&rsquo;t been there for the past two years because of
basketball, which is pretty sad because those are the first years I have missed
it.Q: Talk a little bit about your parents.A: My dad obviously works on the farm. They have a cattle business with
my uncle Chet and my grandpa. My mom was a fifth-grade teacher when I was in
school, but now she is a kindergarten teacher. Q: Did you have your mom as a teacher in fifth grade and how was that?A: I did. She was just my social studies teacher; we couldn&rsquo;t be in her
home room. It was pretty good. I mean, she was pretty tough on my sister and me
when we were at school. It was good though. She couldn&rsquo;t really baby us I guess
&ndash; which I am glad she didn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t have liked that.&nbsp;Q: Who would you say had the biggest influence on you growing up?A: Definitely my parents, but I would say my sister (McKenzie) too. My
sister and my mom were really my role models. They are both really hard
workers.Q: Tell us about your earliest basketball memory.A: When we played MAYB (Mid-America Youth Basketball), we were called
the Trailblazers and I played with a bunch of girls from Beloit, Lincoln and
Salina. I remember when we first started playing we got our butts kicked by a
lot and thenwe all started playing together more and we started getting really
good. That&rsquo;s my earliest memory and playing with my sister too. That&rsquo;s a big
one.Q: You obviously have a close relationship with your sister, how about
your brothers?A: I would say we are pretty close, growing up in age too. When we had
to leave home after Christmas, when you are so close, it is hard to leave my
brothers. They are all very supportive of me, which is awesome.Q: As your high school career was winding down, talk about the
recruiting process and your hopes.A: I was planning on going to a four-year school out of high school,
but that didn&rsquo;t really work out for me. I had a bunch of JUCOs (junior
colleges) recruiting me and some smaller schools, but I didn&rsquo;t want to go that
route. Hutch was really recruiting me and they said that if I wanted an
opportunity to go play somewhere else that a two-year commitment was the way to
go. At first I was really hesitant about it, because I didn&rsquo;t want to go to a
JUCO. But, honestly, that was probably one of the better decisions I ever made
because I made a lot of friends there and I learned a lot through basketball. I
had an awesome coach in John Ontjes. He was amazing.Q: What do you think were the biggest benefits of going to Hutchison
Community College?A: When I went to Hutch it obviously opened a lot of opportunities,
because I am here at KU. That was one of the biggest things. I also became a
better basketball player by going to Hutch as well. Q: Were there off the court benefits too?A: I felt like all the girls at Hutch too were really hard workers
because they wanted to go and play somewhere else. I met a lot of great friends.
One of my friends, Kalani (Purcell), she is from New Zealand and she plays at
BYU. Most of the girls go on and play somewhere else, which is cool. Q: Being at Kansas, is that kind of icing on the cake so to speak?A: I just wanted to be able to play Division I basketball and KU just
makes it even better because you are representing the state of Kansas. I&rsquo;m from
a small town in Kansas, so it is pretty awesome.Q: Growing up in a small community do you feel any pressure to
represent your hometown? A: I think everyone is just really proud of me, because I did go to
such a small school. Everyone in the town knows too, so I just think they are
really proud. There is some pressure, but since I have been hurt I haven&rsquo;t
really felt it yet. I just want to play and make everyone proud.Q: You have had a couple of setbacks that have kept you off the court,
how are you holding up?A: It has been really rough because I actually tore my ACL last
February at the end of the season. Then during the summer, I was rehabbing my
knee and injured my ankle. So, I haven&rsquo;t played in nine or 10 months. So it has
been really rough and I just have to stay positive I guess, it is the only
thing you can do.Q: What do you miss the most not being out on the floor?

A: I miss competing. That&rsquo;s my favorite. Just
getting to compete and play. I am very competitive and I am not a very good
loser, that&rsquo;s for sure.

<p>Q: Smith Center, Kansas is kind of small but mighty isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>A: Yes, it is in the middle of nowhere and we are known for the
football team.</p>
<p>Q: Nolan Cromwell, Steve Tasker, Mark Simoneau and even the voice of
the Chiefs Mitch Holthus all call Smith Center home. With only a population of
1,600, how has Smith Center produced so many individuals?</p>
<p>A: It is super small. The closest Walmart is probably an hour away,
which I tell the girls that and they are amazed and are like, &ldquo;How do you do
that?&rdquo; Smith Center is really about athletics, so just growing up there was
kind of cool to be a part of that. I wasn&rsquo;t in high school when the huge
football thing was going on, I was in junior high still, but it was pretty
cool.</p>

Potentially, other black people can look at us and know that they can swim, because now we live in a culture where it&rsquo;s just not something we do. Last year at the NCAA Championships it was 1-2-3 in the 100 free and there were two from Stanford &ndash; Simone Manuel and Lia Neal, they were black so we are obviously making something happen. It&rsquo;s cool to be not the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; swimmer.[[MORE]]Q: How did you get started is swimming?A: None of my family were swimmers. I&rsquo;m actually the first college athlete from my family. I was in a day care and we had pool time and so I would go play in the pool. The lifeguard was the coach of the rec team that swam at that pool &amp;ndash; we&rsquo;re still really close to this day&amp;ndash; but she came up to me one day and was like, &lsquo;Are you interested in swimming?&rsquo; I had no idea if I was or not but my parents found out about it and I just ended up on the rec team. I think I started out not really liking it and then as I got better I was like, &lsquo;Oh this is fun.&rsquo;I actually ended up being too fast for that league so I began swimming exhibition and I had to compete against boys and my dad told m that it was time to move up a little. So I moved to a team called Tahlequah Stingrays. It was about an hour away from our house so we would drive an hour there, swim an hour then drive an hour back. It was not fun sometimes. A year later we decided to find a team closer to home and that&rsquo;s how I found Swim Tulsa and have been with them ever since.Q: How old were you when you started at the daycare?A: I think I was 7 or 8.Q: Because you were good at swimming, is that what interested you in it?A: I guess, yeah. I just wanted to try something new. My parents have shown me pictures of how I just jumped in the water when I was really little. I guess I always liked the water.Q: How did your parents meet?A: My dad is from North Carolina and my mom is from back home, Tulsa. My dad was going to college at ORU (Oral Roberts University) and my mom was just working at Warehouse Market and my dad was actually a Tae Kwon Do instructor and my mom wanted to learn some self defense and that&rsquo;s how they met. He was her instructor.Q: Do you think growing up in a mixed family was any different than other kids you grew up with?A: I feel like it&rsquo;s just natural. People ask me, &lsquo;Is your mom or dad black?&rsquo; Obviously, I&rsquo;m half black. I don&rsquo;t mind when people ask me about myself.Q: Did you ever swim on a team with other black kids?A: No, I have always just swam with white teammates.Q: Did that ever feel awkward?A: No, we are all just swimmers. That&rsquo;s just how I&rsquo;ve always felt. It&rsquo;s kind of weird. When I go to sectionals, there are a couple other black girls and it&rsquo;s nice not to be the only one. I&rsquo;ve always been pretty buff and people will ask if I lift weights and I&rsquo;ve never touched a weight in my life until I got here. People are always telling me, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re black.&rsquo;Q: When you were at sectionals and there were other black swimmers, would you go out of your way to talk to them?A: No. I&rsquo;m not really a person to just go up to someone, but I think if I see them I will be like, &lsquo;Oh hey, there&rsquo;s my friend, we&rsquo;re cool.&rsquo;Q: According to a study by USA Swimming and the University of Memphis (2010), nearly 70 percent of African-Americans don&rsquo;t know how to swim compared to 40 percent of Caucasians. How do you feel about that?A: I feel like since it&rsquo;s perceived that we can&rsquo;t swim, black parents don&rsquo;t push their kids to learn how to swim. Since more white people swim, I feel like more parents of white children are going to want their kids to know to swim. It&rsquo;s a generational thing.Q: Do you think access to pools or swimming facilities is a contributing factor?A: Swimming isn&rsquo;t really a big thing in Oklahoma. There aren&rsquo;t any colleges for swimming except for NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics). Also, my high school didn&rsquo;t have a pool, we had to travel to another pool 20 minutes away. I feel like if more pools were built then more people would go want to try and more people would be swimming. I don&rsquo;t know how this would happen, but I would like to see more black people swimming because it&rsquo;s not a scary thing.Q: Did you ever play any other sports, or have you always been a swimmer?A: I didn&rsquo;t. I did ballet when I was in kindergarten, but I&rsquo;ve always been a swimmer.Q: Neither of your parents ever swam, but do you think you got your ability from either one of them?A: My dad was a football player in high school but he didn&rsquo;t pursue it after that.Q: Your dad got involved in the booster club when you were swimming in high school, was that pretty cool?A: It was nice to have a little say on stuff because he would be working on it at home and he would ask me what I thought about things.Q: Were your parents pretty supportive?A: Yeah, they&rsquo;re very supportive, props to them. They were at 9 out of 10 of my meets. My mom would take off of work to come to my meets. I really appreciate them being there for me and supporting me if I had a bad race. I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done without them there, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be this far. My dad is always pushing me to be the best that I can. I really appreciate them both.Q: There were three African-Americans on the 2012 Olympic team, sadly an all-time high. Do you hope that there will be more in 2016?A: Yeah, I think it would be really cool to see more black people, but it&rsquo;s not too big of a deal to me. It&rsquo;s hard to think about being at the Olympics. If I make a Trial cut, I would be really excited, but if I don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. I think that&rsquo;s also how I feel about black swimmers in the Olympics.Q: Is that something you are working toward?A: Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely working toward the times that I need to get, but I&rsquo;m not going to go cry in my room if I don&rsquo;t.Q: Without many black swimmers in the sport who did you look up to? Did you have a swimming hero growing up?A: It&rsquo;s changed over the years but right now it&rsquo;s Simone Manuel. I look at her Instagram and she&rsquo;s always so happy and it makes me want to be just like her. Q: If you could talk to her, what would you say?A: That she&rsquo;s my inspiration to keep going and to keep changing the culture.Q: What is the team culture like here at Kansas?A: The team is amazing. There&rsquo;s nothing that I feel like I can&rsquo;t do when I&rsquo;m with the team. They are always pushing us to do what we think we can&rsquo;t do and they are super friendly. They don&rsquo;t make us feel like freshmen, they just make us feel like part of the team, like we have been there our whole lives. I like it a lot.Q: Is that one of the reasons you came to Kansas?A: Yeah, when I was on my trip I felt like I was one of them and fit in really well. When I first meet people I&rsquo;m not super outgoing, but once I get warmed up&hellip;Clark (Campbell, head coach) calls me Bri-yonce now because I sing and dance during practice.Q: How do you think your season is going so far?A: Obviously, I want to do the best that I can. I think at TCU I needed to work on my starts. In the sprints it&rsquo;s just technical things that I really have to pay attention to. I think I need to work on my starts and turns. My times are not the best times when looking at the team (as a whole), but they&rsquo;re my personal best in-season times. I think I need to step away from looking at where I am on the team and look at where I am individually because I get too caught up on looking at how fast I am compared to other people. I need to look at what little things I can do to get better individually throughout the season.Q: Has there been anyone in the sprint group that has helped you?A: A lot of it is the coaching, but Haley (Molden) and Hannah (Driscoll) are really good at pushing me.Q: Do you feel some sense of being part of a larger Jayhawk community?A: Yeah, definitely. There is a wide variety of diversity on every team. I feel like it&rsquo;s really easy to become friends with a lot of athletes from different sports." />

Volleyball is a popular sport in Puerto Rico, but was it offered in high
school?A:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s offered, but it&rsquo;s not as big as it is here. The resources and facilities
aren&rsquo;t quite as good, but we will practice and workout wherever. We just go
with it.&rdquo;[[MORE]]Q: Is
it surprising to you how important sports are in the U.S.?A: &ldquo;It
is crazy, but I think it&rsquo;s good. They work really hard here to give athletes
whatever we need to be the best at their sport. I think that&rsquo;s really, really
good. Back home, everything is at your expense. There are no major resources,
no major donors like we have here. We have to make due with whatever we have
and just give it our all.&rdquo;Q: Was
that hard on your family to fund such an expensive sport?A: &ldquo;I
know they&rsquo;ve had to make sacrifices. I am thankful because my family is able to
pay for my volleyball career, but I know they&rsquo;ve made sacrifices for me. I&rsquo;ve
had friends that needed to ride to practices with me because they didn&rsquo;t have a
car or didn&rsquo;t have money for gas. There are lots of cases back home when people
have to quit. They have the ability to be great, but they don&rsquo;t have the
resources or the money to go where they need to be (to play).&rdquo;Q: What
is great about Ponce, Puerto Rico?A: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not big, it&rsquo;s a small city. Puerto Rico is really small compared to the United
States. I love Ponce. For me, it&rsquo;s the capital. Where I&rsquo;m from, the beaches are
only an hour away. It&rsquo;s great. The weather is great, too, it&rsquo;s like summer
every time of the year. I love it.&rdquo;Q: Have
you dealt with snow yet?A: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never seen snow. Never in my life. But I&rsquo;m Kansas now so I&rsquo;m excited about it.
I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.&rdquo;Q: How
hard is it to move to another country when you&rsquo;re 17 years old?A: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been looking forward to this moment for my entire life. I love it here. People
are helping me every single way they can, so for me, it&rsquo;s not that hard. It&rsquo;s
hard being away from family because I don&rsquo;t have any family here, but I&rsquo;m
loving it. It&rsquo;s not as hard as it&rsquo;s probably supposed to be for me.&rdquo;Q: When
did this idea of coming to school in the U.S. come about?A: &ldquo;My
dad went to school in the U.S. He played baseball for a school named Mount
Vernon in Ohio. Since we were little, he said, &lsquo;You guys are going to go to the
States.&rsquo; He wanted us to have a better life and better opportunities. Since I
was little, I knew I would go to the United States. I started really working
for it in ninth or 10th grade, that&rsquo;s when scouts start to come
watch you play.&rdquo;Q: The
day that your dream became a reality and you signed at KU &ndash; what was that
moment like?A:
&ldquo;When I signed with KU, I was about to leave for Mexico (to go play for the
Puerto Rican national team). So I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to really celebrate
it, but it was amazing. I was so relieved. I knew I was coming to a great place
with great coaches and great girls. I was so excited about it.&rdquo;Q: Then
you&rsquo;re in Canada and the ultimate heartbreak &ndash; you tear your ACL. What went
through your mind?A: &ldquo;KU.
That was my first thought. I wondered if they were going to be mad at me. Were
they going to be disappointed? But they were great. I texted with the coaches
and told them what happened. They said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got your back. Don&rsquo;t worry about
it. We&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to get you healthy and make you better than you
were.&rsquo; I thought to myself, &lsquo;Oh my God. I picked the right place.&rsquo; I was so
relieved.&rdquo;Q: With
a torn ACL you cried two times. Two times?!A: &ldquo;I
cried once when I couldn&rsquo;t sleep because of the pain and then I cried the next
day after it happened. After that, I never cried again. I told myself I&rsquo;m not
going to cry or complain about something I can&rsquo;t control.&rdquo;Q:
That&rsquo;s a pretty mature mindset for a 17-year old. Where did that come from?A: &ldquo;My
parents and my brother. My brother had Tommy John surgery and I never saw him
complain once. I have a friend that had surgery on his foot, and it was huge.
It just exploded, every part of his leg was swollen. He came back from it even braver,
so that&rsquo;s been an inspiration for me. I&rsquo;m not going to say it&rsquo;s not
frustrating, but I&rsquo;m just working on getting better every single day. I&rsquo;m
working on that and working on my patience. This is a really slow process.&rdquo;Q: What
have you learned about yourself during your recovery process?A:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned how much I love volleyball. I&rsquo;ve never loved volleyball more than
I love it now.&rdquo; Q: What
have the biggest differences been between Puerto Rico and the United States?A: &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
talking about people in general, here in Kansas people are so kind, so polite.
People here have manners. You walk by someone, they stop and say, &lsquo;Hi.&rsquo; You say
something and they say, &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo; We have kind people and people with
manners back home, but not as many as there are here. If we&rsquo;re talking about
volleyball, here they are so loud. People are always talking and the energy is
way different than back home. At home, they are more aggressive. I&rsquo;m sure they
are aggressive here, too, but they just show it in a different way.&rdquo;Q: What
is your native language?A:
&ldquo;Spanish. I know you noticed the accent. They try to teach you English when you
are little. You start taking English classes in first grade, but they aren&rsquo;t
that good. So you will learn if you try to learn it, but even if you don&rsquo;t you
can still get an &lsquo;A&rsquo; and not know English at all. I don&rsquo;t know how I learned
it. Maybe because my dad speaks perfect English. He always expected us to learn
English, especially since he wanted us to move here.&rdquo;Q:
Since you and your siblings are in America, is that a pretty common theme in
Puerto Rico?A:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare. If you don&rsquo;t play sports, it&rsquo;s rare to come to the States. It&rsquo;s
expensive and not everyone can pay (to do) that. I know some people who are
here from Puerto Rico and don&rsquo;t play sports, but it&rsquo;s rare. I know not everyone
has this opportunity, not everybody gets to be at KU. I&rsquo;m grateful for this
opportunity.&rdquo;Q: If
you have no plans to move back to Puerto Rico, does that make your parents sad?A: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think so. They want me to have better opportunities. I know my mom wants to
move here like crazy, but we have a family business back home. I&rsquo;ll go back and
visit.&rdquo;" />

you actually born and raised in Germany?A:
&ldquo;Yes, I was born in Burghausen, which is a city close to Munich and the border
of Austria. That&rsquo;s where I grew up.&rdquo;Q: Is
the border between Austria and Germany a hard line or do the two countries
cross into each other a lot?A: &ldquo;My
dad is Austrian, so I&rsquo;m technically half Austrian-half German. It doesn&rsquo;t
really matter honestly. The border is just there. I have a couple of friends
that lived in Austria but would go to school in Germany.&rdquo;[[MORE]]Q: You
certainly were successful in German soccer, playing for your club team, state
team and national team, but do they have high school teams? Like what we think
of in the U.S.?A:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that is extremely different in Europe in general. We don&rsquo;t
really do school sports. There are no high school teams and very few college
teams, everything is club. You just pay one fee a year, and it&rsquo;s very little.
When I was growing up, all of my friends and I would go outside and play soccer
all the time. But here, club soccer is really expensive.&rdquo;Q:
Germany is all about soccer, I take it?A: &ldquo;Oh
yeah. Soccer is the national sport all over Germany. We don&rsquo;t really do
basketball, although basketball is growing right now. We don&rsquo;t have football or
baseball and stuff like that. The fact that we don&rsquo;t have school sports is
another reason that soccer is so big. All kids do is play soccer. That&rsquo;s the
first thing kids do. I was maybe five or six when I started playing, very
little.&rdquo;Q: Is the
U.S. getting any closer to European-levels of soccer hype?A: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think so. It&rsquo;s growing here in the States, but it isn&rsquo;t anywhere close to
what it is in Europe. On the other hand, you guys are big in baseball, football
and basketball.&rdquo;Q: Do
you feel like Germany is able to become unified by soccer? Whereas in the U.S.,
there are too many sports for people to all focus on just one?A:
&ldquo;That is something very different. The United States is very unified in a lot
of things. It&rsquo;s a very, very patriotic country compared to Germany. I think
that has to do with history, obviously, but I also think history plays a role
in our lives where we are sometimes not allowed to show that kind of
patriotism. So, soccer is definitely a place where we can show our national
pride.&rdquo;Q: Is
it not ok to show patriotism in Germany?A: &ldquo;No,
it&rsquo;s totally ok. It would be better if we would be more patriotic sometimes,
but I think people still judge us about the history. They don&rsquo;t know that
things change. I keep getting those weird (World War II) questions about
history and if that stuff is still going on. No, it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;Q:
People still ask you about World War II crimes committed in Germany even now?A: &ldquo;People
ask me if there are still Nazis there. There are Nazis in the U.S. There will
always be people in the world that exclude others. Germany is probably one of
the safest and one of the most advanced countries in general.&rdquo;Q:
Speaking of historical presence, are there monuments or museums to honor those
killed in concentration camps?A: &ldquo;Yes
there are for sure. Auschwitz is one of the big ones and Dachau, as well, have
been made into museums to show how it was back then. Every school takes a trip
there, but I actually had a soccer commitment so I couldn&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;m definitely
going to go at some point.&rdquo;Q:
Knowing that has to make it all the more hurtful that people would assume or
ask you if such terrible were things were still happening in Germany,
considering the monuments and honor bestowed on its people through those
museums?A:
&ldquo;Yes, and I also think our school system in Germany is completely different
than it is in the United States. That&rsquo;s part of it. We learn not just about
German history, but about every country. We learn everything about U.S.
history. I think that&rsquo;s something that the U.S. could improve on, to teach kids
history and points of view from other countries.&rdquo;Q: Is
it hard in some ways to not have an edge against America?A: &ldquo;All
over Europe, people have an edge against America. Just because of some sort of
attitude that might be portrayed on TV or through the media in general. Also,
America is kind of excluded. (People here) are very privileged. On the other
hand, we also admire them because of all of the culture they have. I think
Germany may be a more free country than what it is in the United States,
especially with all of the newer issues in the U.S. right now, like gay
marriage. People are more open-minded in Germany, which I think is extremely
cool. There are so many conservative ways of thinking in the United States that
are still mind blowing to me, whereas Germany has already been past that for
years. Gay marriage is one, health care is another.&rdquo;Q: What
are the biggest differences that you see between Germany and the United States?A: &ldquo;There
is a huge divide between the very rich and the very poor. It doesn&rsquo;t exist in
those same extremes in Germany. There are obviously rich and poor people, but
in Europe people have a more equal chance to grow as a person. School is free.
You don&rsquo;t have to pay to go to college. So it&rsquo;s not a money thing, it&rsquo;s more
about if you can put the effort into it. There is a very small percentage of
people (in America) that are born into the very poor class and make it out of
there. The people that might not have a lot of money or have the same IQ levels
might just be stranded.&rdquo;Q: Do
you want to move back to Germany after you graduate?A:
&ldquo;Definitely. I want my kids to grow up in Germany. I want them to learn that
culture and have good opportunities. Coming to the U.S. was never really my
goal, but a really cool thing about the States is that you can do sports and
school at the same time. It&rsquo;s very difficult to do that in Germany, which is
definitely something I want to see a change in at some point. But right now in
Germany, playing a professional level of soccer and going to school is just
impossible because school and sports are not connected. They are here, which is
really, really nice.&rdquo;Q: Has
your family been to visit you in the U.S.?A:
&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t. Well, my brother did come for a week this summer. He traveled in
the States and made a quick stop in Lawrence.&rdquo;Q: Your
hometown of Emmerting sounds like a very small town through research. Does it
seem small?A: &ldquo;It
is super tiny. It has probably 4,000 people there now, so it&rsquo;s growing, but
it&rsquo;s still very, very tiny. There&rsquo;s only like an elementary school, a church
and one or two restaurants and grocery stores, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;Q: Is
Germany split into states, too?A:
&ldquo;Yes, we have 16 states. Obviously, our states are very tiny compared to the
ones here. Kansas is probably bigger than Germany. I love where I&rsquo;m from. We
have lakes and I live close to the mountains. The nature is very pretty, but
there is also a lot of history going on. We have a lot of castles. Where I&rsquo;m
from, we actually have the longest castle in the world (Burghausen Castle). You
can go in it, drink coffee in there, there are businesses in there and I think
a couple people even live in there.&rdquo;" />

<p>Q: Were
you actually born and raised in Germany?</p>
<p>A:
&ldquo;Yes, I was born in Burghausen, which is a city close to Munich and the border
of Austria. That&rsquo;s where I grew up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q: Is
the border between Austria and Germany a hard line or do the two countries
cross into each other a lot?</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;My
dad is Austrian, so I&rsquo;m technically half Austrian-half German. It doesn&rsquo;t
really matter honestly. The border is just there. I have a couple of friends
that lived in Austria but would go to school in Germany.&rdquo;</p>

of five siblings and all five of you play sports. Where did all that
athleticism come from?A: &ldquo;My
dad played soccer at UAB, but my mom actually never played. They are both from
Sudan, and women weren&rsquo;t really allowed to play sports at the time she was
growing up over there. She didn&rsquo;t know anything about sports when she got to
the United States, but she&rsquo;s always loved coming to all of our games. It&rsquo;s fun
to see how much she&rsquo;s learned over the years.&rdquo;[[MORE]]Q: What
is the native language in Sudan?A:
&ldquo;Arabic. I can understand it 100 percent, but speaking it is harder. I can
speak it pretty well. My mom only speaks Arabic to us, but I&rsquo;ll answer back in
English. That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re used to, so that&rsquo;s why my Arabic is a little
off. My dad speaks English at home, but my mom speaks Arabic all the time.
Unless she&rsquo;s really mad at us, then she&rsquo;ll say something in English.&rdquo;Q: Is
that your mom&rsquo;s way of holding onto to her homeland and that culture?A:
&ldquo;Yes. She took us to Arabic school on Saturdays and Sundays while we were
growing up in Georgia. At the time I complained, &lsquo;Mom, we have to go to regular
school Monday through Friday, why do we have to do this, too?&rsquo; But now I
understand why. She really wants to keep that culture in us. Here in America
there are so many cultures, but I go to school and I don&rsquo;t speak Arabic or do
any of the same things (from Sudan) so she&rsquo;s trying to keep that in us. I
started going to Arabic school probably in kindergarten. It&rsquo;s like learning how
to read The Koran and stuff like that. I was never great at it. It was like
regular school, there just wasn&rsquo;t as much of it. I always called those kids (who
attended Arabic classes) my cousins. I stopped a little bit earlier, around my
freshman year, because I always had races on the weekends. My older sister was
better at it than me, so she stopped going around seventh grade. She was born
in Sudan and actually lived there for a couple of years, so she had a heads up
on us. It was rough, but it&rsquo;s worth it now.&rdquo;Q: What
prompted your family to move from Sudan to America?A: &ldquo;My
dad first went to London to go to school and then he attended UAB (University
of Alabama at Birmingham). For him, it was about having a better life. At the
time in Sudan, they weren&rsquo;t in a huge war, but he knew that coming here would
further his education and quality of life. The quality of life in Sudan&hellip; it&rsquo;s a
third-world country. It&rsquo;s war-torn and he had the opportunity to go, so he did.
His mom and dad passed away when he was young. His older brother and sister
took care of him since he was the youngest. They encouraged him to go to
America and further his education. There were a good amount of Sudanese people
in Birmingham, so he went down there and started a life there. Then he (and his
family) moved to Georgia.&rdquo;Q: When
you visit your family in Sudan, are there things that took you by surprise? You
mentioned that it&rsquo;s a third-world country, did anything stick out to you when
you were there?A: &ldquo;The
water. My little sister got malaria while we were there once because of the
mosquitoes. We all got (vaccination) shots, but we went to where my mom is from
and that is right by the Nile River. There are mosquitoes everywhere and the
water is really dirty. When we first got there, my uncle had to go and buy us
water from the store. I remember thinking, &lsquo;Man, I&rsquo;m tired of waiting for him
to bring the water.&rsquo; There was a water cooler there, but they told us not to
drink out of it for two to three weeks, so we could slowly adapt to it. I just
drank it anyway. I got the worst upset stomach. The water isn&rsquo;t clear. It&rsquo;s
rough. When it&rsquo;s rainy season, some of the houses aren&rsquo;t well-kept &ndash; it&rsquo;s a
dictatorship &ndash; there are some people who literally live off a dollar per day.
There are kids begging on the streets. The government soldiers walk around
streets with their AK-47s. They don&rsquo;t shoot people randomly, but it&rsquo;s insanity.
You can&rsquo;t speak up. The people there live in fear. I&rsquo;m so happy I live in
America, how do they do it? They just go on with their lives with a smile on
their faces.&rdquo;Q: How
did your sister recover from malaria?A: &ldquo;She
was in the hospital for a while. I didn&rsquo;t even notice it at first, but when we
look at photos now, you can see how skinny she got. She was in the hospital in
Sudan toward the last month of us being there (for a summer visit). They had
good doctors there, but it still took her a while to recover and to gain the
weight back.&rdquo;Q: What
happens when you get malaria? How did your sister know she was sick?A: &ldquo;She
was throwing up a lot. My mom could just tell. People in Sudan know exactly
what the symptoms of malaria are. I don&rsquo;t remember everything that happened,
but I remember my mom taking her to the doctor and she came out to tell us,
&lsquo;Your sister has malaria.&rsquo; We didn&rsquo;t know how big of a deal malaria was at the
time. She recovered from it, but it took a toll on her body.&rdquo;Q: Is
malaria common in Sudan?A: &ldquo;It
might be better now, but at the time if you didn&rsquo;t get the injection, you would
get it. Those mosquitos there are everywhere. We slept with netting over us
because some of the beds were outside. Sometimes I would fall asleep with my
face pressed against the side of the netting and my face would just be covered
in bites. They can&rsquo;t get in the netting, but they can sit on the net and bite
you. It&rsquo;s deadly in some parts of the country where they don&rsquo;t have good
healthcare.&rdquo;Q: You
and your siblings (Alla, Mohammed, Lena, Muiz) have beautiful names. What is
their origin? Are they family names?A: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
Muslim. Mohammed, my brother, is from the Prophet Mohammed. Alla, I&rsquo;m not sure
where her name came from, but my younger sister&rsquo;s name is Mrwa. But, my grandma
didn&rsquo;t like the name that my mom picked so she picked Lena. The name Lena isn&rsquo;t
even on her birth certificate, but everyone calls her that. Even on her AAU
team and at her school, everyone calls her Lena even though it&rsquo;s not her real
name. My grandma wanted my mom to change it, so she did. I&rsquo;ve called her Mrwa
maybe five times in my whole life.&rdquo;Q: Do
you still have family in Sudan?A: &ldquo;I
have an aunt here in Lawrence, but the rest of my extended family is all in
Sudan. I haven&rsquo;t been back there in three years. That was the last time I saw
my grandma. Regular kids get to see their grandma like every other weekend it
seems like. We talk and we try to FaceTime, she&rsquo;s kind of learning how to do
that.&rdquo;Q: Is
that sad for you that your mom never had the chance to also add to that
athletic lineage in your family? Is that common for kids in Sudan &ndash; girls or
boys &ndash; to not have those type of opportunities?A:
&ldquo;Yeah, it sucks. It&rsquo;s so different over there. I&rsquo;ve been there four or five
times and I used to go play soccer with some of the kids there. Those kids were
so athletically talented, but because of how it is over there, they never get
to showcase their skills. Hopefully, one day, things will change.&rdquo;Q: Now
that you are older, it is easier for you to see how much your parents
sacrificed for their kids?A: &ldquo;I
think about that all the time. It&rsquo;s like moving to another country and starting
a life. They sacrificed so much for us. You don&rsquo;t notice that as a kid, you
spend so much time complaining. Now, I see myself in my younger brother (Muiz).
I just remind him, &lsquo;You have it so good. You don&rsquo;t understand how much they&rsquo;ve
done for us.&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t give him long lectures, I&rsquo;ll just say something quick to
him. He has a little attitude and I guess I was probably like that as a kid,
too. But they really did sacrifice so much for us. I didn&rsquo;t see it at the time,
but I&rsquo;m glad I do now.&rdquo;Q: If
you hear a teammate complain &ndash; are you quick to remind them of how bad it could
be?A: &ldquo;I
catch myself complaining sometimes. Then I&rsquo;ll think to myself how good we have
it. Sure, the drinking water might be warm sometimes or we&rsquo;ll get cold water in
the showers, but it&rsquo;s those things that we take for granted. If everybody could
just go there once, they would see how good we have it here in America. They&rsquo;d
learn to love everything.&rdquo;Q: How
does the Muslim culture handle athletics and athletic fame? As a two-time state
champion, was that something you could celebrate?A: &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t bad for me, but for my sister it would have been different. My mom
didn&rsquo;t want my sisters playing sports since they would have to expose their
hair. There were things that she didn&rsquo;t want them to do. My sister said that
(playing sports) would be good for discipline. My sister was really the one
that started us off. Then, I followed in her footsteps. I played football
before I decided I was too small. With the guys it&rsquo;s different in Muslim
culture. I could play sports, but in Sudan women wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play
sports unless they were covered up and
all that. So with me, playing sports was normal for the most part, but it would
have been entirely different for my sister. My mom might have let her, but in a
very strict home, in Sudan especially, the women would&rsquo;ve either not been
allowed to play or would have to play covered up. Lena doesn&rsquo;t play basketball
with anything (covering her) and our other sister, Alla, when she ran, wasn&rsquo;t
covered up. Our mom was kind of lenient on that part. They wanted us to have
fun.&rdquo;" />

Unfortunately, my iguana got too big so I was going to build him a bigger cage, because they need a bigger cage once they grow. I was letting Pet World hold him for a while so I could build him a bigger cage. Then, Pet World burned down so I lost him in the fire. I was going to have an iguana, four snakes and a puppy.&rdquo;Q: So how do your human roommates feel about the snakes?A: &ldquo;Scared at first. My first roommate was Dexter McDonald, and he was not a fan of any kind of snakes. For him, I just kept them in my room, kept them locked up and kept him as comfortable as possible. I&rsquo;m not fan mice either, but snakes take care of the mice.&rdquo;Q: What all goes in to owning snakes?A: &ldquo;Snakes are a little easier (than most other pets). At the same time, you want to play with them at least 30 minutes a day so they get used to humans and won&rsquo;t snap and bite you. So, for them, 30 minutes a day is good for that. They are really good on feeding. You can go a month or two without feeding them. They eat mice, and I like to feed them live mice so it won&rsquo;t be boring for them. I fed them before camp so they will be good until I&rsquo;m done with camp.&rdquo;Q: So what is the story with your puppy? What does he think of these snakes?A: &ldquo;His name is Bando. My teammate, Ronnie Davis, who was going home to Oklahoma, knew I always had puppy fever. As a kid, I never really could have gotten a dog as a pet, so it was my chance to get a dog and I got a dog. Ronnie said his friend&rsquo;s dog was having puppies, and I said, &lsquo;What?!&rsquo; I jumped on it right there. He turned 12 weeks today. I introduced him to the snakes last week. He (the puppy) was really interested, so he was sniffing, while the snakes were trying to run away.&rdquo;Q: Where did this animal love come from? Were you a typical little football player growing up?A: &ldquo;For me it was just animals. Coming from New Orleans, I played a little pee-wee football, but at the same time, I was just always helping around the house and all that. I looked up to my big cousin, who was a really good football player and went to Grambling State to play football. I was just trying to stay out of trouble, since it was a troubled neighborhood. My grandpa had a little farm not that far from the neighborhood, so really, my first pet was a pony. We would always go buy hay and then I would always see chickens. My grandpa would be like, &lsquo;If you catch them, you can keep them.&rsquo; Every time I would go out there I would catch one or two chickens a day. That was my first actual pet.&rdquo;Q: Being on the farm kept you out of trouble - was there quite a bit of trouble?A: &ldquo;Yes. There were drugs, violence and killing a lot. Where I come from in New Orleans, you just want to stay out of that and be on a straight path, so I would do sports. Doing sports all the time wouldn&rsquo;t lead you to trouble, but you want to do sports 24/7 because that little bit of free time would get you in trouble real fast. I had to have a curfew, my momma and grandma were real hard on me, so I would just always be on the farm messing with animals.&rdquo;Q: Can New Orleans be a pretty violent place?A: &ldquo;Yes, it was. During that time it was probably one of the top murder-rate cities. You really have to be careful going around there.&rdquo;Q: Is that how you lost your dad?A: &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly how I lost my dad. I don&rsquo;t really know if he was drug dealing or not, but he got shot. I was still at a young age, around 7 or 8 years old. He just got shot up, and I was in Houston at the time. I found out when I got the newspaper saying that my father got shot up and died. That&rsquo;s how it really happened.&rdquo;Q: Did that have a lot of impact on you staying down that good road?A: &ldquo;It did have a big impact. After the shooting, everybody wanted to move back to New Orleans. I got that news like, &lsquo;Man, it&rsquo;s a huge risk to move back.&rsquo; I really wasn&rsquo;t involved in sports (in New Orleans) like I was involved with sports when I moved to Houston. So it was either stay in Houston, continue in sports and doing good in school and coaches being in my ear saying, &lsquo;This will get you to college.&rsquo; (or go back to New Orleans). I had to influence my mama to stay down there with me, and I know it was hard on her because all my family had moved back to New Orleans pretty quickly. My mama stuck it out with me for the next four or five years &ndash; and now I&rsquo;m blessed to come to college and get a degree.&rdquo;Q: How hard is it to be a good kid when there are all these temptations and pressure from your friends?A: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard, peer pressure. You want to go out, you want to sneak out and mom is asleep. You don&rsquo;t want to wake her up because she has to go to work. You want to go outside, but it&rsquo;s a huge contradiction to go outside and get a whooping or something like that. You want be on the good side of your friends, but you want to be on the good side of your family, too. It&rsquo;s just real tough growing up. It is tough saying no to your friends, tough obeying your family, but you just have to go through it.&rdquo;Q: Do you name all of your snakes?A: &ldquo;Yes I did. The first snake I got was a boy. My teammate and I got him at the same time. His name is Versace, because he was really a Versace Python. He got tired of his snake, and his was a girl, so I just kept his. My sister named his Chanel, going by clothes. Then I always wanted an Albino Bald Python. It&rsquo;s really cute, too. It&rsquo;s bright yellow and has red eyes, so I named him King. Then I just&hellip; animals are very lonely so I got a girl for him, and her name is Queen Kelly.&rdquo;Q: Did you work on the farm for your grandfather?A: &ldquo;Yeah, so that&rsquo;s why I really love animals. It started off with ponies and horses, cleaning up every day after them. I had a jar of worms. I had chickens. I was catching lizards, anything you caught on the farm you raised it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so comfortable with animals and snakes and everything. I used to catch snakes. They used to bite me, but it was just a little pinch so you get used to it. Man, I really love animals. I had every pet, so that&rsquo;s where I get it from.&rdquo;Q: Do you want to be a veterinarian?A: &ldquo;Yeah, still today, as a kid I always wanted to be a veterinarian or a zookeeper.&rdquo;Q: When Hurricane Katrina caused your family to evacuate New Orleans &ndash; was that a blessing in disguise?A: &ldquo;A lot of people don&rsquo;t look at it in a positive light, but my family, we look at it in a positive light. It&rsquo;s a blessing for me. It washed away all those negative sayings and we got a brand new start. It was eye-opening and my mom got me involved with sports heavily and that got me to school. If I was in New Orleans, I&rsquo;d be on the farm basically, so I really have to go to school and play the sport that I love.&rdquo;Q: What advice would you give those kids who are picking between the path of being good or picking that path of getting into trouble?A: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be real hard at the beginning, just know your friends are going to influence you in all different ways. Some of them will influence you to do sports, or some will influence you to stay out late and try to get you to do things that are really bad. You just have to listen to your parents or a mentor, get the right guidance during that time and just do the right thing.&rdquo;" />
