<h3>LECTURE</h3>
<h4>Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam</h4>
<em class="datetime">Fredrik Logevall<br>
7:30-9:30pm Thursday, April 21 | The Commons<br>
Sponsored by the Hall Center for the Humanities</em>
<p>
In May, President
Obama declared 2012
the 50th anniversary
of the start of
Vietnam War yet the
first American names
etched onto the
Vietnam Memorial
died in 1959. Why
the discrepancy?
There’s no way to
answer that question
without answering
the larger question of how America ended up at
war in Vietnam. In his groundbreaking new
book Embers of War, Harvard historian Fredrik
Logevall traces the origins back further than
most Americans realize. In doing so he not only
demonstrates how at least six presidents made
strategic foreign policy errors that would
ultimately lead to the deaths of some 58,000
Americans, he also illuminates the disturbing
parallels with our current experience in
Afghanistan and the Middle East.
Fredrik Logevall is an
award-winning historian,
accomplished educator, and
prolific writer on the
Vietnam War and its legacy.
Embers of War: The Fall of an
Empire and the Making of
America’s Vietnam won both
the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in History and the
prestigious Parkman Prize, which deemed it an
“extraordinary work of modern history.” The
book draws on more than a decade of research,
accessing sources and archives on three
continents never before tapped.

<h3>SYMPOSIUM</h3>
<h4>Justice in the low-carbon shift</h4>
<em class="datetime">9:00am-3:30pm Thursday, April 28 | The Commons</em>
<p>
Funded by a Starter Grant and organized by Uma Outka (School of Law), Rachel Krause (School of Public Affairs and Administration), and Ward Lyles, (School of Architecture, Design, and Planning), this symposium will look at how local energy transitions can be leveraged to advance community social justice objectives. The symposium is part of a larger research project entitled “Localized Energy and Climate Adaptation: Advancing Community-Scale Social Justice Goals”, and is situated at the nexus of two approaches to climate change research - mitigation and adaptation - and explores their intersection through a social equity lens. 
<p>
Climate change is driving innovation in policy and technology around two core imperatives. The first, climate mitigation, involves curbing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. The second, climate adaptation, anticipates climate impacts and aims to strengthen the capacity for resilience in our communities, infrastructure, and environment. These dual aims intersect at the local level in the context of distributed renewable energy, energy efficiency, and microgrid development – key components of the low-carbon energy transition underway in the United States. The Symposium will engage this intersection and explore how local energy transitions can be leveraged to advance local social justice objectives that prioritize the needs and rights of traditionally disadvantaged groups, asking:
<li>What does social justice look like in the context of a low-carbon energy transition?</li>
<li>What avenues exist for effectively incorporating social justice priorities into the development of distributed renewables and climate adaptation policy?</li>
<li>What legal, political, or structural obstacles complicate social justice considerations in this context?</li>
<p><strong>Registration is free and lunch will be served.

<h3>FACULTY EVENT</h3>
<h4>RED HOT RESEARCH: POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT</h4>

<p>
Red Hot Research is intended to bring together scholars from all disciplines, in response to the call set forth by Bold Aspirations. The format of these sessions is inspired by Pecha Kucha, which features short, slide-based talks that introduce audiences to a topic. Each installment features faculty members, speaking for six minutes each. Audience members are encouraged to connect with the speakers (and each other) during breaks. We hope that through these sessions, faculty members will have a venue for cross-disciplinary partnering and exploration.<p>

<h3>WORKING GROUP</h3>  
<h4>C21 Consortium</h4>  
<em class="datetime">2:00-3:30pm Friday, May 6 | The Commons<br>  
Organized by CTE, CODL, the Center for STEM Education Sponsored by the Office of the Provost and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Hosted by The Commons</em>
<p> 
KU’s C21 (i.e., 21st Century) Consortium is a learning community of individuals from across campus who share a goal of improving and accelerating course redesign at KU. It will connect instructors involved in course redesign with each other and with multiple resources that will facilitate their work. The hub of the consortium is the new CLAS Teaching Postdoc program for the natural sciences and mathematics and social and behavioral sciences. Thus, C21 includes the teaching postdocs and the department faculty with whom they are collaborating, faculty leaders in hybrid course redesign, instructors implementing redesigned courses, and specialists from CTE, CODL, and the Center for STEM Education. The Consortium will also include graduate assistants to support consortium members’ work on their courses, plus a pool of undergraduate peer mentors. Contact Judy Eddy (jeddy@ku.edu) at the Center for Teaching Excellence, with questions.

<h3>SYMPOSIUM</h3>
<h4>The Scholarship of Social Engagement Symposium</h4>
<em class="datetime">October 20-21, 2016 | The Commons<br>
Supported by an Interdisciplinary Starter Grant</em><p>
The University of Kansas is convening a symposium that assembles
internationally recognized thought leaders on the subject of critical
engagement. These practitioners and their work are presented at conferences, through exhibits, and in literature. <p>
Our
symposium seeks to investigate the theoretical underpinnings of such
work and translate these action-based community engagement efforts into
interdisciplinary and theoretically-based scholarship. We will convene this
group of scholars in order to establish a framework for the critical inquiry
and review of the public impact of socially engaged discourse and design.
The symposium will gather a group of scholars, practitioners, critics, and
historians to discuss different aspects, forms, and features of social
engagement that have developed across time and regions.<p>
Additional information on the symposium, submission, calendar of events,
registration, and organizers can be found at:
<a href="http://sse2016.wix.com/socialenagementku" target="new">http://sse2016.wix.com/socialenagementku</a>
<p>
This symposium and the research it supports are led by Joe Colistra, Architecture; Martha Rabanni, Peace & Conflict Studies; Jeremy Shellhorn, Design; Amanda Schwegler, Center for Civic & Social Responsibility; and Andi Witczak, Service Learning at K-State Olathe.
